INSTALL file for pyFreenet

System requirements:

   This package requires:

     - Python2.3 or later
     - access to a freenet FCP port, on same or other machine

     - third party module 'SSLCrypto' (source included here) (optional)
     - OpenSSL libraries and headers (optional)

Installation: (if not wanting freedisk crypto, skip to step 4)

   1) Ensure libopenssl and libopenssl-dev are installed

      These packages include the runtime library and headers for the
      OpenSSL software. This is a dependency of the python 'SSLCrypto'
      package, which is an optional dependency of PyFreenet.

      You don't have to install libopenssl[-dev] and SSLCrypto, because
      pyFreenet can run fine without it, except that there will be no
      encryption in the Freedisk framework.

      If you're happy to use freenetfs without encryption, or you don't
      need to run freenetfs, then you can just skip to Step 4.

   2) Test if SSLCrypto is installed

      If you already have the Python 'SSLCrypto' package installed,
      you can skip to step 4.

      You can test if SSLCrypto is installed by typing:

        $ python -c "import SSLCrypto"

      If the command completes quietly, then SSLCrypto is installed
      and working. Otherwise, if you see something like 'ImportError:...',
      you need to install SSLCrypto.

   3) Install SSLCrypto if needed

      (i)   go in to the 'dependencies' directory
      (ii)  unpack both the 'Pyrex...' and the 'SSLCrypto...' tarballs
      (iii) cd into the 'Pyrex-...' directory, become root, then type:

               python setup.py install

      (iv)  cd into the 'SSLCrypto...' directory, become root, then type:

               python setup.py install

   4) Now, you should be able to install pyFreenet and its applications.
      To do this, get back into the toplevel pyFreenet directory, then
      become root, then type 'python setup.py install'

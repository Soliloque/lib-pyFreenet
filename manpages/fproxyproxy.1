.SH "NAME"
.LP 
fproxyproxy \- a name\-service\-enabled http proxy service over fproxy
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP 
\fBfproxyproxy\fP [\fIoptions\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
\fBfproxyproxy\fR is an http proxy server that sits on top of
Freenet's FProxy server. It translates human\-friendly
freenet 'domain names' received from the client into proper
freenet URIs, feeds these URIs into fproxy, and feeds FProxy's
output back to the client.
.LP
Whereas FProxy is designed to be used as a web server,
fproxyproxy is designed to be configured into the browser as
an http proxy server. Fortunately, with excellent quick
proxy\-switching features of modern browsers (such as the
\fBSwitchProxy\fR extension in \fBFirefox\fR), this
becomes an easy and simple operation.
.LP
As an example of the use of fproxyproxy,
if you had a 'freenet name services' record
for the 'pyFreenet' website, you would be able to type
\fBhttp://pyFreenet\fR
into your browser, and be viewing the pyFreenet freesite! (As long
as you have set up fproxyproxy as an http proxy in your web browser).
.LP
fproxyproxy is a proof of concept for using secure, human\-friendly
freesite addresses within freenet, and is intended to be used
alongside the \fBfcpnames(1)\fR utility.
.LP
If you want to access FProxy directly in a browser configured to use
fproxyproxy as a proxy server, just enter the address
\fBhttp://fproxy\fR.

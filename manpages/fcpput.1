.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
fcpput is a simple command\-line FCP client program for inserting
keys or directories into Freenet.

If the program completes successfully, it will print to standard
output a \fIfreenet URI\fP under which the key can be later retrieved.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help information and exit
.TP 
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version number and exit
.TP 
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Enable very verbose output, including FCP transcripts,
to the stderr stream.
.TP 
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-fcpHost=<hostname>\fR
Use FCP interface at host <hostname>,
defaults to 127.0.0.1
.TP 
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-fcpPort=<port>\fR
Use FCP interface at port <port>
.TP 
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mimetype=<mimetype>\fR
Specify the mimetype under which the key is to be
inserted. If not specified, the program will try
to guess a mimetype from the input file extension
(if present), or from a 'file extension' suffix on
the URI. If neither of these are present, default
mimetype is text/plain.
.TP 
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-priority=\fIpriority\fR
Sets priority to \fIpriority\fR. Valid values are
0 (highest) to 6 (lowest). Default is 4.

Run a program, and insert its standard output
as URI \fIKSK@somekey\fP

.TP 
\fBfcpput \-H 192.168.10.4 CHK@/fred.jpg somefile\fP

which this key can be later retrieved will be printed to stdout.
